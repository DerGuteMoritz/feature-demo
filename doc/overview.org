* What is Immutant?

  A collection of libraries that can be embedded within any Clojure
  application. Optionally, the application can be deployed to a stock
  [[http://wildfly.org][WildFly]] application server.

* The [[https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant/tree/2x-dev][lein-immutant]] plugin

  Only required if deploying your app to WildFly.

** Tasks

   - lein immutant deploy path-wildfly-install

* Using outside of WildFly

  Set a =:main= in =project.clj=, and start with =lein run=.

* Immutant API's

  Functions whose side effects invoke JBoss services

  An alternative to Java interop, which we also expose

  Our [[file:~/src/feature-demo][demonstration app]]

** immutant.web

   - app segmentation via virtual host and/or context path
   - automatic session replication in a cluster
   - auto-reloading in dev mode
   - static resources served via [[http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.resource.html#var-wrap-resource][ring.middleware.resource/wrap-resource]]
   - :ring config, e.g. :handler, :init, :destroy,
     stacktraces?, :auto-reload?, :reload-paths

   examples: [[../src/demo/web.clj][demo/web.clj]]

** immutant.scheduling

   - schedules specified by maps created with helper functions
   - singleton by default (runs on only one node in cluster)
   - not durable
